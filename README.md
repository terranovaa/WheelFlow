# WheelFlow
WheelFlow is an Android Application that focuses on collecting and sharing geo-localized accessibility information about routes in order to assist wheelchair users. 
 Users can search for a path from a source to a destination and receive accessibility information about the path. The core of the application is the collection of vibration data based on crowdsourcing: route contributor users can collect data using their smartphone while they are on the move and share it with a web-server responsible for classifying the data and handling the routing requests. The architecture is composed by a Python server and an Android Client application. The Python server stores the model used to classify the data, handles the interaction with the database and answers the clientsâ€™ requests allowing users to ask for routing information taking in consideration the accessibility of the locations.
